# Simon Says Game 🎮

A fun and interactive **Simon Says** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game challenges your memory by growing the sequence with every level.

## 📋 Features

**Dynamic Gameplay**:

A box blinks, and you need to click on it.

With each level, the sequence grows by adding another blink.

You must repeat the entire sequence from the beginning in order every time!


**Visual Feedback**:

The selected box blinks white.

A satisfying click effect when you interact with the boxes.

The screen turns red for 2 seconds if you click the wrong sequence, and the game resets.


**High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your highest score without refreshing the page.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
